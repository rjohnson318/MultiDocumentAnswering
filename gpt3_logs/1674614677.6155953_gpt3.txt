QUESTION: How long much longer was the first Roe V Wade case vs the case that happened in 2021-2022?


PASSAGE: wrought by Roe and Casey would be prolonged. It is far betterfor this Court  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 77 Opinion of the Court and the countryto face up to the real issue without further delay. VI We must now decide what standard will govern if state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge and whether the law before us satisfies the appropriate standard. A Under our precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard for such challenges. As we have explained, procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right because such a right has no basis in the Constitutions text or in our Nations history. See supra, at 839. It follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson, 372 U. S., at 729730; see also Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 484486 (1970); United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938). That respect for a legislatures judgment applies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral substance. See, e.g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 365368 (2001) (treatment of the disabled); Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 728 (assisted suicide); San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 3235, 55 (1973) (financing public education). A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a strong presumption of validity. Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319 (1993). It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id., at 320; FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S.  78 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court 307, 313 (1993); New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955). These legitimate interests include respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development, Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 157158; the protection of maternal health and safety; the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures; the preservation of the integrity of the medical profession; the mitigation of fetal pain; and the prevention of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability. See id., at 156 157; Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; cf. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 728 731 (identifying similar interests). B These legitimate interests justify Mississippis Gestational Age Act. Except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, the statute prohibits abortion if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks. Miss. Code Ann. 4141191(4)(b). The Mississippi Legislatures findings recount the stages of human prenatal development and assert the States interest in protecting the life of the unborn. 2(b)(i). The legislature also found that abortions performed after 15 weeks typically use the dilation and evacuation procedure, and the legislature found the use of this procedure for nontherapeutic or elective reasons [to be] a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession. 2(b)(i)(8); see also Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 135143 (describing such procedures). These legitimate interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents constitutional challenge must fail. VII We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents Opinion of the Court Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 79 Appendix A to opinion of the Court a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority.
