DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

This handbook says that employees are entitled to certain unpaid parental leave, including leave to attend school-related events. It also says that employees may be granted extended personal leave at the discretion of management, and that bereavement leave is available for employees who have been employed for at least one year.
