QUESTION: How long much longer was the first Roe V Wade case vs the case that happened in 2021-2022?


PASSAGE: sidethose who sought to advance the States interest in fetal lifecould no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 4345. (2) The quality of the reasoning. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163164. Roes failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of factfinding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the meaning of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional right of personal privacy. Id., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599600. None of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed potential life. When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were consistent with, among other things, the relative weights of the respective interests involved and the demands of the profound problems of the present day. Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring deficiency was Roes failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163. The arbitrary viability line, which Casey termed Roes central rule, has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. The most obvious problem with any such      6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus argument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily dependent on factorssuch as medical advances and the availability of quality medical carethat have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roes central holding, but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roes trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and substituted a new and obscure undue burden test. Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roes analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roes reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roes central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roes status as precedent, and imposed a new test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. Pp. 4556. (3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be overruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workablethat is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Caseys undue burden test has scored poorly on the workability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the undue burden


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The first Roe v Wade case lasted from 1973-2021, while the second Roe v Wade case (which is ongoing as of 2021-2022) has lasted for less than a year. The first case was significantly longer because it was decided by the Supreme Court, while the second case is still being decided by lower courts. The reasoning behind Roe v Wade has also been criticized by the Supreme Court in later cases, which has led to confusion and inconsistency in its application.
