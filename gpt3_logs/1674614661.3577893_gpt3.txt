QUESTION: How long much longer was the first Roe V Wade case vs the case that happened in 2021-2022?

S. 582, 640642 (2016) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Substantive due process is the core inspiration for many of the Courts constitutionally unmoored policy judgments. Third, substantive due process is often wielded to disastrous ends. Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 16). For instance, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), the Court invoked a species of substantive due process to announce that Congress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories. See id., at 452. While Dred Scott was overruled on the battlefields of the Civil War and by constitutional amendment after Appomattox, Obergefell, 576 U. S., at 696 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), that overruling was [p]urchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 515 U.

The harm caused by this Courts forays into substantive due process remains immeasurable. * * * Because the Court properly applies our substantive due process precedents to reject the fabrication of a constitutional right to abortion, and because this case does not present the opportunity to reject substantive due process entirely, I join the Courts opinion. But, in future cases, we should follow the text of the Constitution, which sets forth certain substantive rights that cannot be taken away, and adds, beyond that, a right to due process when life, liberty, or property is to be taken away. Carlton, 512 U. S., at 42 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Substantive due process conflicts with that textual command and has harmed our country in many ways. Accordingly, we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity. _________________ _________________ Cite as: 597 U.

I write separately to explain my additional views about why Roe was wrongly decided, why Roe should be overruled at this time, and the future implications of todays decision. I Abortion is a profoundly difficult and contentious issue because it presents an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of a pregnant woman who seeks an abortion and the interests in protecting fetal life. The interests on both sides of the abortion issue are extraordinarily weighty. On the one side, many pro-choice advocates forcefully argue that the ability to obtain an abortion is critically important for womens personal and professional lives, and for womens health. They contend that the widespread availability of abortion has been essential for women to advance in society and to achieve greater equality over the last 50 years. And they maintain that women must have the freedom to choose for themselves whether to have an abortion. On the other side, many pro-life advocates forcefully argue that a fetus is a human life. They contend that all human life should be protected as a matter of human dignity     2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH, J., concurring and fundamental


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The first Roe v Wade case was in 1973, and the most recent one was in 2021-2022. The difference between the two cases is that the Roe v Wade case from 1973 was about whether or not a woman had the right to have an abortion, while the case from 2021-2022 was about whether or not a state could ban abortion. In the Roe v Wade case from 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman has the right to have an abortion, and in the case from 2021-2022, the Supreme Court ruled that a state can ban abortion.
