QUESTION: Why did the supreme court strike down Roe V wade?


PASSAGE: trimester of pregnancy was regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to achieve viability, i.e., the ability to survive outside the womb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting potential life,1 it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on previability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roes reasoning. One prominent constitutional scholar wrote that he would vote for a statute very much like the one the Court end[ed] up drafting if he were a legislator, but his assessment of Roe was memorable and brutal: Roe was not constitutional law at all and gave almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.2 At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third of the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process. It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As  1 Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 163 (1973). 2 J.

S., at 222, and it sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for a half century.4  Eventually, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court revisited Roe, but the Members of the Court split three ways. Two Justices expressed no desire to change Roe in any way.5 Four others wanted to overrule the decision in its entirety.6 And the three remaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling opinion, took a third position.7 Their opinion did not endorse Roes reasoning, and it even hinted that one or more of its authors might have reservations about whether the Constitution protects a right to abortion.8 But the opinion concluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances, required adherence to what it called Roes central holdingthat a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life before viabilityeven if that holding was wrong.9 Anything less, the opinion claimed, would undermine respect for this Court and the rule of law. Paradoxically, the judgment in Casey did a fair amount of overruling. Several important abortion decisions were  4See R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L.

==========

RESPONSE:

The supreme court struck down Roe v Wade because they found that States had a legitimate interest in protecting potential life, but this interest could not justify any restriction on previability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roes reasoning.
