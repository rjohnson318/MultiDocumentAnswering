QUESTION: How long much longer was the first Roe V Wade case vs the case that happened in 2021-2022?


PASSAGE: reasoning that viability marks the earliest point at which the States interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions and that 15 weeks gestational age is prior to viability. Jackson Womens Health Org. v. Currier, 349 F. Supp. 3d 536, 539540 (SD Miss. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 945 F. 3d 265 (2019). We granted certiorari, 593 U. S. ___ (2021), to resolve the question whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional, Pet. for Cert. i. Petitioners primary defense of the Mississippi Gestational Age Act is that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review. Brief for Petitioners 49. Respondents answer that allowing Mississippi to ban pre-viability abortions would be no different than overruling Casey and Roe entirely. Brief for Respondents 43. They tell us that no halfmeasures are available: We must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. Brief for Respondents 50. II We begin by considering the critical question whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Skipping over that question, the controlling opinion in Casey reaffirmed Roes central holding based solely on the doctrine of stare decisis, but as we will explain, proper application of stare decisis required an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based. See infra, at 4556. We therefore turn to the question that the Casey plurality did not consider, and we address that question in three steps. First, we explain the standard that our cases have used in determining whether the Fourteenth Amendments reference to liberty protects a particular right. Second, Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 9 Opinion of the Court we examine whether the right at issue in this case is rooted in our Nations history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of what we have described as ordered liberty. Finally, we consider whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents. A 1 Constitutional analysis must begin with the language of the instrument, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 186189 (1824), which offers a fixed standard for ascertaining what our founding document means, 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 399, p. 383 (1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim that it protects such a right must show that the right is somehow implicit in the constitutional text. Roe, however, was remarkably loose in its treatment of the constitutional text. It held that the abortion right, which is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right to privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U. S., at 152153. And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been found to spring from no fewer than five different constitutional provisionsthe First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Id., at 152. The Courts discussion left open at least three ways in which some combination of these provisions could protect the abortion right. One possibility was that the right was founded . . . in the Ninth Amendments reservation of rights to the people. Id., at 153. Another was that the right was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, or in some combination of those provisions, and that this right had been incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of Rights provisions had by then been incorporated. Ibid; see   10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court also McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 763766 (2010) (majority opinion) (discussing incorporation). And a third path was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments played no role and that the right was
