QUESTION: How long much longer was the first Roe V Wade case vs the case that happened in 2021-2022?

Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 67 Opinion of the Court perceive a decision as having been made for unprincipled reasons when the Court overrules a controversial watershed decision, such as Roe. 505 U. S., at 866867. A decision overruling Roe would be perceived as having been made under fire and as a surrender to political pressure, 505 U. S., at 867, and therefore the preservation of public approval of the Court weighs heavily in favor of retaining Roe, see 505 U. S., at 869. This analysis starts out on the right foot but ultimately veers off course. The Casey plurality was certainly right that it is important for the public to perceive that our decisions are based on principle, and we should make every effort to achieve that objective by issuing opinions that carefully show how a proper understanding of the law leads to the results we reach. But we cannot exceed the scope of our authority under the Constitution, and we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the publics reaction to our work. Cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989); Brown, 347 U. S. 483. That is true both when we initially decide a constitutional issue and when we consider whether to overrule a prior decision. As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained, The Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare decisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task. Casey, 505 U. S., at 963 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). In suggesting otherwise, the Casey plurality went beyond this Courts role in our constitutional system. The Casey plurality call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division, and claimed the authority to impose a permanent settlement of the issue of a constitutional abortion right simply by saying    68 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court that the matter was closed. Id., at 867. That unprecedented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Constitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Constitution gives the judiciary neither Force nor Will. The Federalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Our sole authority is to exercise judgmentwhich is to say, the authority to judge what the law means and how it should apply to the case at hand. Ibid. The Court has no authority to decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently exempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Lochner would still be the law. That is not how stare decisis operates. The Casey plurality also misjudged the practical limits of this Courts influence. Roe certainly did not succeed in ending division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe inflamed a national issue that has remained bitterly divisive for the past half century. Casey, 505 U. S., at 995 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe may have halted a political process, prolonged divisiveness, and deferred stable settlement of the issue). And for the past 30 years, Casey has done the same. Neither decision has ended debate over the issue of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in

RESPONSE:

The first Roe V Wade case was in 1973 and the most recent one was in 2021-2022. The difference between the two cases is that the later one was decided under different circumstances. In the 2021-2022 case, the Court was faced with a challenge to a state law that placed restrictions on abortion. The Court had to decide whether the law was constitutional. In the end, the Court ruled that the law was constitutional.
