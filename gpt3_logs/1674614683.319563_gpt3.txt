Write a detailed summary of the following:

The first Roe V Wade case was in 1973 and the second one was in 2021-2022. The difference between the two cases is that the first one was about regulating abortion during the trimester of pregnancy, and the second one was about whether or not a state can adopt a regulation that imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion.  The first Roe V Wade case was in 1973 and the most recent one was in 2021-2022. The difference between the two cases is that the later one was decided under different circumstances. In the 2021-2022 case, the Court was faced with a challenge to a state law that placed restrictions on abortion. The Court had to decide whether the law was constitutional. In the end, the Court ruled that the law was constitutional.  The Roe v Wade case from 2021-2022 is significantly longer than the first Roe v Wade case. In the first case, the Court struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed potential life. Roe, 410 U. S., at 150 (emphasis deleted); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. However, in the second case, the Court decided that the people of the various States may evaluate those interests differently. In some States, voters may believe that the abortion right should be even more extensive than the right that Roe and Casey recognized. Voters in other States may wish to impose tight restrictions based on their belief that abortion destroys an unborn human being. Miss. Code Ann. 4141191(4)(b). Our Nations historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the peoples elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated. Nor does the right to obtain an abortion have a sound basis in precedent. Casey relied on cases involving the right to marry a person of a different race, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); the right to marry while in prison, Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987); the right to obtain contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972), Carey v. Population Services Intl, 431 U. S. 678 (1977); the right to reside with relatives, Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977); the right to make decisions about the education of ones children, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923); the right not to be sterilized without consent, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); and the right in certain circumstances not to undergo involuntary surgery, forced administration of drugs, or other substantially similar procedures, Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985), Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990), Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952).
