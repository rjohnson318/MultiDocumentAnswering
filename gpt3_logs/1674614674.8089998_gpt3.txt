QUESTION: How long much longer was the first Roe V Wade case vs the case that happened in 2021-2022?


PASSAGE: to choose. Like Roe, Casey grounded that right in the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of liberty. That guarantee encompasses realms of conduct not specifically referenced in the Constitution: Marriage is mentioned nowhere in that document, yet the Court was no doubt correct to protect the freedom to marry against state interference. 505 U. S., at 847848. And the guarantee of liberty encompasses conduct today that was not protected at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment. See id., at 848. It is settled now, the Court saidthough it was not always sothat the Constitution places limits on a States right to interfere with a persons most basic decisions about family and parenthood, as well as bodily integrity. Id., at 849 (citations omitted); see id., at 851 (similarly describing the constitutional protection given to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, [and] family relationships). Especially   10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting important in this web of precedents protecting an individuals most personal choices were those guaranteeing the right to contraception. Ibid.; see id., at 852853. In those cases, the Court had recognized the right of the individual to make the vastly consequential decision whether to bear a child. Id., at 851 (emphasis deleted). So too, Casey reasoned, the liberty clause protects the decision of a woman confronting an unplanned pregnancy. Her decision about abortion was central, in the same way, to her capacity to chart her lifes course. See id., at 853. In reaffirming the right Roe recognized, the Court took full account of the diversity of views on abortion, and the importance of various competing state interests. Some Americans, the Court stated, deem [abortion] nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life. 505 U. S., at 852. And each State has an interest in the protection of potential lifeas Roe itself had recognized. 505 U. S., at 871 (plurality opinion). On the one hand, that interest was not conclusive. The State could not resolve the moral and spiritual questions raised by abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter. Id., at 850 (majority opinion). It could not force her to bear the pain and physical constraints of carr[ying] a child to full term when she would have chosen an early abortion. Id., at 852. But on the other hand, the State had, as Roe had held, an exceptionally significant interest in disallowing abortions in the later phase of a pregnancy. And it had an ever-present interest in ensur[ing] that the womans choice is informed and in presenting the case for choos[ing] childbirth over abortion. 505 U. S., at 878 (plurality opinion). So Casey again struck a balance, differing from Roes in only incremental ways. It retained Roes central holding that the State could bar abortion only after viability. 505 U. S., at 860 (majority opinion). The viability line, Casey thought, was more workable than any other in marking  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting the place where the womans liberty interest gave way to a States efforts to preserve potential life. Id., at 870 (plurality opinion). At that point, a second life was capable of independent existence. Ibid. If the woman even by then had not acted, she lacked adequate grounds to object to the States intervention on [the developing childs] behalf. Ibid. At the same time, Casey decided, based on two decades of experience, that the Roe framework did not give States sufficient ability to regulate abortion prior to viability. In that period, Casey now made clear, the State could regulate not only to protect the womans health but also to promot[e] prenatal life. 505 U. S., at 873 (plurality opinion). In particular, the State could ensure informed choice and could try to promote childbirth. See id.,


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The first Roe V Wade case was decided in 1973, while the most recent case was decided in 2021-2022. The difference between the two cases is that the later case affirmed the right of the individual to make the decision about abortion, while the earlier case only recognized the right of the woman to make that decision. In addition, the later case took into account the diversity of views on abortion and the importance of various competing state interests, while the earlier case did not.
