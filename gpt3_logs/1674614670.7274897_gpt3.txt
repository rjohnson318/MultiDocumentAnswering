QUESTION: How long much longer was the first Roe V Wade case vs the case that happened in 2021-2022?


PASSAGE: pregnant by six weeks of gestation. See A. Branum & K. Ahrens, Trends in Timing of Pregnancy Awareness Among US Women, 21 Maternal & Child Health J. 715, 722    10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment (2017). Almost all know by the end of the first trimester. Pregnancy Recognition 39. Safe and effective abortifacients, moreover, are now readily available, particularly during those early stages. See I. Adibi et al., Abortion, 22 Geo. J. Gender & L. 279, 303 (2021). Given all this, it is no surprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester. See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Abortion SurveillanceUnited States 1 (2020). Presumably most of the remainder would also take place earlier if later abortions were not a legal option. Ample evidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient time, absent rare circumstances, for a woman to decide for herself  whether to terminate her pregnancy. Webster, 492 U. S., at 520 (plurality opinion).* III Whether a precedent should be overruled is a question entirely within the discretion of the court. Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, 212 (1910); see also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991) (stare decisis is a principle of policy). In my respectful view, the sound exercise of that discretion should have led the Court to resolve the case on the narrower grounds set forth above, rather than overruling Roe and Casey entirely. The Court says there is no principled basis for this approach, ante, at 73, but in fact it is firmly grounded in basic principles of stare decisis and judicial restraint.  *The majority contends that nothing like [my approach] was recommended by either party. Ante, at 72. But as explained, Mississippi in fact pressed a similar argument in its filings before this Court. See Pet. for Cert. 1526; Brief for Petitioners 5, 3848 (urging the Court to reject the viability rule and reverse); Reply Brief 2022 (same). The approach also finds support in prior opinions. See Webster, 492 U. S., at 518521 (plurality opinion) (abandoning key elements of the Roe framework under stare decisis while declining to reconsider Roes holding that the Constitution protects the right to an abortion).    Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment The Courts decision to overrule Roe and Casey is a serious jolt to the legal systemregardless of how you view those cases. A narrower decision rejecting the misguided viability line would be markedly less unsettling, and nothing more is needed to decide this case. Our cases say that the effect of overruling a precedent on reliance interests is a factor to consider in deciding whether to take such a step, and respondents argue that generations of women have relied on the right to an abortion in organizing their relationships and planning their futures. Brief for Respondents 3641; see also Casey, 505 U. S., at 856 (making the same point). The Court questions whether these concerns are pertinent under our precedents, see ante, at 6465, but the issue would not even arise with a decision rejecting only the viability line: It cannot reasonably be argued that women have shaped their lives in part on the assumption that they would be able to abort up to viability, as opposed to fifteen weeks. In support of its holding, the Court cites three seminal constitutional decisions that involved overruling prior precedents: Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943), and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937). See ante, at 4041. The opinion in Brown was unanimous and eleven pages long; this one is neither. Barnette was decided only three years after the decision it overruled, three Justices having had second thoughts. And West Coast Hotel was issued against a backdrop of unprecedented economic despair that focused attention on the


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The first Roe V Wade case was decided in 1973, and the most recent case was decided in 2021-2022. The difference between the two cases is that the later case overruled the Roe decision, while the earlier case did not. The length of time between the two cases is thus 48 years.
