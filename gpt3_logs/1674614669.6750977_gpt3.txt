QUESTION: How long much longer was the first Roe V Wade case vs the case that happened in 2021-2022?


PASSAGE: reconsidered. See Janus, 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 38); Ramos, 590 U. S., at ___ ___ (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.) (slip op., at 78). In Part II, supra, we explained why Roe was incorrectly decided, but that decision was more than just wrong. It stood on exceptionally weak grounds.  Roe found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a right to obtain an abortion, but it failed to ground its decision in text, history, or precedent. It relied on an erroneous historical narrative; it devoted great attention to and presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedents on which it relied and the question before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set of rules, with different restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the history of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other cited source; and its most important rule (that States cannot protect fetal life prior to viability) was never raised by any  46 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court party and has never been plausibly explained. Roes reasoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism, even from supporters of broad access to abortion. The Casey plurality, while reaffirming Roes central holding, pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. It revised the textual basis for the abortion right, silently abandoned Roes erroneous historical narrative, and jettisoned the trimester framework. But it replaced that scheme with an arbitrary undue burden test and relied on an exceptional version of stare decisis that, as explained below, this Court had never before applied and has never invoked since. 1 a The weaknesses in Roes reasoning are well-known. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, it imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163164. Dividing pregnancy into three trimesters, the Court imposed special rules for each. During the first trimester, the Court announced, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant womans attending physician. Id., at 164. After that point, a States interest in regulating abortion for the sake of a womans health became compelling, and accordingly, a State could regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. Ibid. Finally, in the stage subsequent to viability, which in 1973 roughly coincided with the beginning of the third trimester, the States interest in the potentiality of human life became compelling, and therefore a State could regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. Id., at 164165.  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 47 Opinion of the Court This elaborate scheme was the Courts own brainchild. Neither party advocated the trimester framework; nor did either party or any amicus argue that viability should mark the point at which the scope of the abortion right and a States regulatory authority should be substantially transformed. See Brief for Appellant and Brief for Appellee in Roe v. Wade, O. T. 1972, No. 7018; see also C. Forsythe, Abuse of Discretion: The Inside Story of Roe v. Wade 127, 141 (2012). b Not only did this scheme resemble the work of a legislature, but the Court made little effort to explain how these rules could be deduced from any of the sources on which constitutional decisions are usually based. We have already discussed Roes treatment of constitutional text, and the opinion failed to show that history, precedent, or any other cited source supported its scheme.  Roe featured a lengthy survey of history, but much of
