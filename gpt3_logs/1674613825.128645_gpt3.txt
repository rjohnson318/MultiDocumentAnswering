QUESTION: Why did the supreme court strike down Roe V wade?


PASSAGE: doctrine that undermined or made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change that had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance because the earlier decision was less than a decade old. (The majority is wrong when it says that we insist on a test of changed law or fact alone, although that is present in most of the cases. See ante, at 69.) None of those factors apply here: Nothingand in particular, no significant legal or factual changesupports overturning a half-century of settled law giving women control over their reproductive lives. First, for all the reasons we have given, Roe and Casey were correct. In holding that a State could not resolve the debate about abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, the Court protected womens liberty and womens equality in a way comporting with our Fourteenth Amendment precedents. Casey, 505  32 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting U. S., at 850. Contrary to the majoritys view, the legal status of abortion in the 19th century does not weaken those decisions. And the majoritys repeated refrain about usurp[ing] state legislatures power to address a publicly contested question does not help it on the key issue here. Ante, at 44; see ante, at 1. To repeat: The point of a right is to shield individual actions and decisions from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. Barnette, 319 U. S., at 638; supra, at 7. However divisive, a right is not at the peoples mercy. In any event [w]hether or not we . . . agree with a prior precedent is the beginning, not the end, of our analysis and the remaining principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against overruling Roe and Casey. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000). Casey itself applied those principles, in one of this Courts most important precedents about precedent. After assessing the traditional stare decisis factors, Casey reached the only conclusion possible that stare decisis operates powerfully here. It still does. The standards Roe and Casey set out are perfectly workable. No changes in either law or fact have eroded the two decisions. And tens of millions of American women have relied, and continue to rely, on the right to choose. So under traditional stare decisis principles, the majority has no special justification for the harm it causes. And indeed, the majority comes close to conceding that point. The majority barely mentions any legal or factual changes that have occurred since Roe and Casey. It suggests that the two decisions are hard for courts to implement, but cannot prove its case. In the end, the majority says, all it must say to override stare decisis is one thing: that it believes Roe and Casey egregiously wrong. Ante, at 70. That rule could equally spell the end of any precedent with which a bare majority of the present Court disagrees.   Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 33 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting So how does that approach prevent the scale of justice from waver[ing] with every new judges opinion? 1 Blackstone 69. It does not. It makes radical change too easy and too fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new judges. The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now it has the votes to discard them. The majority thereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law. A Contrary to the majoritys view, there is nothing unworkable about Caseys undue burden standard. Its primary focus on whether a State has placed a substantial obstacle on a woman seeking an abortion is the sort of inquiry familiar to judges across a variety of contexts. June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 6) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in

The supreme court struck down Roe v Wade because they believe that it is an egregious decision that is hard for courts to implement. They also believe that it is unfair to the majority of Americans who do not agree with the decision.
