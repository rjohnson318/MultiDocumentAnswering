QUESTION: Why did the supreme court strike down Roe V wade?


PASSAGE: ____ (2022) 55 Opinion of the Court Justice White complained that the Court was engaging in unrestrained imposition of its own extraconstitutional value preferences. Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 794 (dissenting opinion). And the United States as amicus curiae asked the Court to overrule Roe five times in the decade before Casey, see 505 U. S., at 844 (joint opinion), and then asked the Court to overrule it once more in Casey itself. 2 When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, very little of Roes reasoning was defended or preserved. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The Court did not reaffirm Roes erroneous account of abortion history. In fact, none of the Justices in the majority said anything about the history of the abortion right. And as for precedent, the Court relied on essentially the same body of cases that Roe had cited. Thus, with respect to the standard grounds for constitutional decisionmakingtext, history, and precedentCasey did not attempt to bolster Roes reasoning. The Court also made no real effort to remedy one of the greatest weaknesses in Roes analysis: its much-criticized discussion of viability. The Court retained what it called Roes central holdingthat a State may not regulate previability abortions for the purpose of protecting fetal life but it provided no principled defense of the viability line. 505 U. S., at 860, 870871. Instead, it merely rephrased what Roe had said, stating that viability marked the point at which the independent existence of a second life can in reason and fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. 505 U. S., at 870. Why reason and fairness demanded that the line be drawn at viability the Court did not explain. And the Justices who authored the controlling opinion conspicuously   56 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court failed to say that they agreed with the viability rule; instead, they candidly acknowledged the reservations [some] of us may have in reaffirming [that] holding of Roe. Id., at 853. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roes trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and substituted a new undue burden test, but the basis for this test was obscure. And as we will explain, the test is full of ambiguities and is difficult to apply.  Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roes analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roes reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roes central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roes status as precedent, and imposed a new and problematic test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. As discussed below, Casey also deployed a novel version of the doctrine of stare decisis. See infra, at 6469. This new doctrine did not account for the profound wrongness of the decision in Roe, and placed great weight on an intangible form of reliance with little if any basis in prior case law. Stare decisis does not command the preservation of such a decision. C Workability. Our precedents counsel that another important consideration in deciding whether a precedent should be overruled is whether the rule it imposes is workablethat is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792 (2009); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 283284 (1988). Caseys undue burden test has scored poorly on the workability scale.  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 57 Opinion of the Court 1 Problems begin with the very concept of an undue burden. As Justice Scalia noted in his Casey partial dissent, determining


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

There are a number of reasons why the Supreme Court struck down Roe v Wade. Firstly, the Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. Secondly, the Court did not reaffirm Roes erroneous account of abortion history. Thirdly, the Court failed to remedy one of the greatest weaknesses in Roes analysis: its much-criticized discussion of viability. Finally, the Court imposed a new and problematic test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent.
